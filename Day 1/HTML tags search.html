                <p>
                    The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents,
                    which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the
                    Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.

                <p>
                    The i HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the
                    normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms,
                    taxonomical designations, among others.

                <p>
                    The u HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be
                    rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation.
                    This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be 
                    altered using CSS.

                <h3>button tag</h3>
                <p>
                    The button HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with
                     a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. 
                     Once activated, it then performs an action, such as submitting a form or 
                     opening a dialog.

                <h3>hr tag</h3>
                <p>
                    The hr HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-
                    level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift
                     of topic within a section.

                <h3>br tag</h3>
                <p>
                    The br HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). 
                    It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of 
                    lines is significant.
